# Exposure
### A website were photographers and editors can share and edit and enhance each others photographs!

Exposure is an image sharing website targeted at people who enjoy creative and inspiring photography as well as people who have a passion for editing such photos. What sets as apart from other image sharing websites like Instagram and flicker is the fact that we allow and encourage users to edit photos that other users have posted. This creates a creative environment that matches passionate editors with passionate photographers. We achieve this environment with our innovative tools and features that allow users to see and switch between different edited versions of the same image and see information about who edited and posted it. Exposure also features a robust web-based editor and ability to download images and reupload it after using your favorite image editor.

## When was it started?
Exposure began development in the summer of 2020 it was started by a pair of computer science students during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown to improve their web development skills and to pass the time in a productive manner.

## What has been achieved so far?
- Gallery page that displays all images in a google photos like masonry pattern.
- Images on the gallery page can be sorted using various parameters or can be search for using titles or tags.
- Ability to flip through multiple edits of an image on gallery page.
- Password protected log-in system with user profiles. Keeps track of each users uploaded, edited and liked images.
- Robust web-based editor and ability to download images and reupload it after using your favorite image editor.

## What still needs work, how you can contribute
- Improvements to the UX and UI to make the website sleeker and easier to use.
- Make the editor more efficient and easier to use.
- Stop all images from loading on page load. Implement loading more images on scroll.
- Implement ways of protecting copyright of photographers and editors.
- Implement ways of stopping unwanted and explicit content being uploaded to the site. (admin system)

Although allot of effort has been put in already, we do believe that there is still much more to do to take the project to the next level. If you are passionate about working on any of the issues listed above or if you just want to improve your web coding skills please consider adding your contributions. We appreciate all improvements and fixes, big or small but for larger changes to the project please contact the team first.
