            <h2>What is Exposure?</h2>
            <p>Exposure is an image sharing website targeted at people who enjoy creative and inspiring photography as
                well as people who have a passion for editing such photos. What sets as apart from other image sharing
                websites like Instagram and flicker is the fact that we allow and encourage users to edit photos that
                other users have posted. This creates a creative environment that matches passionate editors with
                passionate photographers. We achieve this environment with our innovative tools and features that allow
                users to see and switch between different edited versions of the same image and see information about
                who edited and posted it. Exposure also features a robust web-based editor and ability to download
                images and reupload it after using your favorite image editor.
